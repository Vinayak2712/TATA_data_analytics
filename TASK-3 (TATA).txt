TASK 3:

In this task, you will create the visuals around four of the questions that the CEO and CMO have requested. You can use either Tableau or Power BI to create the visuals and weâ€™ve provided the data in the resources below. 
Both Power BI and Tableau have free trials that can be accessed in order to complete this task. You can find a resource below that directs you how to download these free trials.

Data cleanup 
Before you can begin the analysis, make sure that the data is cleaned properly. You have noticed that the data contains some returns to the store which are provided in negative quantities and there are unit prices which were input in error. You will need to perform the following steps to clean this data.

Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0
Please note that in order to apply the checks that have been mentioned above, you would need to use conditional formulas where the logic would state that if the conditions are met then the tool should exclude the data from analysis. You can also use data transformation methods to get rid of the bad data. Both these methods are provided in the resources section. Once this is done, the data will be good to be used for further analysis. Please note that this data should be cleaned up before attempting any question.

Create each visual on a separate tab with the name of the tab displaying the question number. Once the visuals are created, save the files and upload them below. 
For Tableau users, you would need to upload in .twbx format whereas Power BI files need to be saved in .pbix format. 
Instructions on how to save in these formats are provided in the resources section.

Should you get stuck, please reference the Visuals Hints document in the resources.
